        <p style='padding-left:5px;'>The Hecatonchire project aims to bring together the flexibility of virtualization, cloud and high performance computing in order to break free of current cloud limitation. This project extends pre-existing virtualization technology and allows dynamic, on-the-fly aggregation of virtual machines into larger SMP virtual systems. On-demand provisioning and re-provisioning of SMP systems alongside normal cloud VMs without the requirement of dedicated physical hardware or separate infrastructure. The SMP virtual system also benefit from all virtualization and cloud features as we can add and remove on the fly as well as move allocated VM though the mean of live migration. Finally this project deliver a framework that breaks free of current limitation imposed by current virtualization and physical server by enabling true flexibility in term of performance and resource management life cycle. As a result it will enable true cloud paradigm through the datacenter resource disaggregation.</p>
