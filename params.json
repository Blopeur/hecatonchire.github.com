This project extends pre-existing virtualization technology and allows dynamic, on-the-fly aggregation of virtual machines into larger SMP virtual systems. On-demand provisioning and re-provisioning of SMP systems alongside normal cloud VMs without the requirement of dedicated physical hardware or separate infrastructure. The SMP virtual system also benefit from all virtualization and cloud features as we can add and remove on the fly as well as move allocated VM though the mean of live migration. Finally this project deliver a framework that breaks free of current limitation imposed by current virtualization and physical server by enabling true flexibility in term of performance and resource management life cycle. As a result it will enable true cloud paradigm through the datacenter resource disaggregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lego Cloud Datacenter Disaggregation\r\nData center architecture has taken strides toward logical organization in the past few years as the computing model has moved toward disaggregation. By breaking out the functions of storage, computing, and networking, and optimizing the delivery of each, enterprises have made some significant improvements in data center performance. Disaggregation, in general, provides three primary benefits:\r\n\r\nBetter Performance: When a function (storage, computing, memory , device or networking) is bundled together with other functions, the critical services are typically delivered by running software on general-purpose processors. This delivers far slower performance than is possible using purpose-built hardware devices. By isolating each function, thus limiting the scope of what each box must do, it becomes possible to deliver dedicated hardware and software that dramatically increases performance.\r\n\r\nSuperior Scalability: Because functions are isolated from each other, disaggregation gives data center operators the freedom to alter one function without impacting the other two.\r\n\r\nImproved Economics: Storage, computing , memory , devices and networking infrastructure can be deployed cost-effectively because provisioning is improved and disparate equipment is consolidated. Much of the complexity of administering each function is hidden, since each is isolated from the other. Disaggregation is also very tightly linked with virtualization, which allows for sharing of physical equipment across multiple customers, departments or applications. Virtualization significantly decreases up-front capital expense, as well as long-run operational expense, because there are simply fewer boxes to buy and manage, and compute resources can be managed as a consolidated pool, rather than on a box-by-box basis.\r\n\r\nDisaggregation thus represents a major force in the evolution of the computing model in the data center. And through providing distributed shared memory model through the previous 3+ strands of research within hecatonchire we aim to bring  true and transparent disaggregation of datacenter resources.  Hence, enabling  both the simplification and optimization of the cloud  resulting in a more efficient and productive data center.\r\n"}
